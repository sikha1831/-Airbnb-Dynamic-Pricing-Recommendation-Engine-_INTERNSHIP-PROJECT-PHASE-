Airbnb Dynamic Pricing & Dashboard Analysis

This project combines machine learning, data visualization, and SQL analytics to help Airbnb hosts **predict optimal listing prices** and build **insightful dashboards** in Power BI and Tableau.

Project Summary
- A **Random Forest Regressor** is trained on real Airbnb data to predict nightly prices.
- A cleaned dataset is generated for dashboard creation.
- Multiple visuals (pie chart, bar chart, scatter plots, maps) are prepared to support **business decision-making**.
- Output is compatible with **Power BI** and **Tableau**.
